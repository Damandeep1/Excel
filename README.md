The basic agenda of this project was to find out the cancellations are happening, through which cancellations are hapeening, what is the time period of the time for which
cancellations are happening, so that we can manage our hotel accordingly.
I used Power Querry Editor which enables us to do all the transformations in data.
I used Pivot Tables for summarizing the data, with the help of these pivot tables I was able to make different charts and graphs for my Dashboard.
I added slicers in my dashboard to make it user freiendly.
The most booking were in August  and cancellations were also high during this month.
